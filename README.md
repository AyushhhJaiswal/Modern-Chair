# Modern chair
### This is a simple mini project created using HTML and CSS that showcases a modern chair with a unique color selection feature. <br>
When a different color option is chosen, the chair's color changes with a smooth animation, <br>
and the background color of the page transitions to match the selected chair color.<br>
